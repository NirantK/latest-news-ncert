COMBUSTION AND FLAME
COMBUSTION AND FLAME

We use different kinds of fuel for

various purposes at home, in
industry  and  for  running
automobiles. Can you name a few fuels
used in our homes? Name a few fuels
used in trade and industry. What fuels
are used for running automobiles? Your
list  will  contain  fuels  like  cowdung,
wood,  coal,  charcoal,  petrol,  diesel,
compressed natural gas (CNG), etc.

You are familiar with the burning of a
candle. What is the difference between the
burning of a candle and the burning of a
fuel like coal? May be you were able to
guess  right:  candle  burns  with  a  flame
whereas coal does not. Similarly, you will
find  many  other  materials  burning
without a flame. Let us study the chemical
process of burning and the types of flame
produced during this process.

6.1  What  is  Combustion?
Recall  the  activity  of  burning  of
magnesium ribbon performed in Class
VII. We learnt that magnesium burns to
form  magnesium  oxide  and  produces
heat and light (Fig. 6.1).

We can perform a similar activity with
a piece of charcoal. Hold the piece with
a  pair  of  tongs  and  bring  it  near  the
flame of a candle or a  Bunsen burner.
What do you observe?

We find that charcoal burns in air.
We  know  that  coal,  too,  burns    in  air
producing  carbon  dioxide,  heat  and
light.

Fig. 6.1 : Burning of magnesium

A  chemical  process  in  which  a
substance reacts with oxygen to give off
heat  is  called  combustion.  The
substance that undergoes combustion
is said to be combustible. It is also called
a fuel. The fuel may be solid, liquid or
gas.  Sometimes,  light  is  also  given  off
during combustion, either as a flame or
as a glow.

In  the  reactions  mentioned  above
magnesium  and  charcoal  are
combustible substances.

We  were  told  that
food is a fuel for

our body.

© NCERTnot to be republishedRightly so. In our body
food is broken down by
reaction  with  oxygen  and

heat  is  produced.  We

learnt  that  in  Class  VII.

Activity  6.1

Collect  some  materials  like  straw,
matchsticks,  kerosene  oil,  paper,
iron nails, stone pieces, glass, etc.
Under  the  supervision  of  your
teacher  try  to  burn  each  of  these
materials one by one. If combustion
takes  place  mark  the  material
combustible, otherwise mark it as
non-combustible (Table 6.1).

which combustion takes place.

Caution : Be careful while handling
burning candle.
Fix a lighted candle on a table. Put
a glass chimney over the candle and
rest  it  on  a  few  wooden  blocks  in
such a way that air can enter the

chimney [Fig. 6.2(a)]. Observe what
happens to the flame. Now remove
the blocks and let the chimney rest
on  the  table  [Fig.  6.2(b)].  Again
observe  the  flame.  Finally,  put  a
glass  plate  over  the  chimney  [Fig.
6.2(c)]. Watch the flame again. What
happens  in  the  three  cases?  Does
the flame flicker off? Does it flicker
and  give    smoke?  Does  it  burn
unaffected? Can you infer anything
at all about the role played by air in
the process of burning?

We find that for combustion, air is
necessary. The candle burns freely in
case  (a)  when  air  can  enter  the
chimney from below. In case (b), when
air does not enter the chimney from
below, the flame flickers and produces
smoke.  In  case  (c),  the  flame  finally
goes  off  because  the  air  is  not
available.

65

produces  its  own  heat  and
light. Is it also some kind of

combustion?

In  the  sun,  heat  and  light  are
produced  by  nuclear  reactions.  You
will learn about this process in higher
classes.

Activity  6.3

Place  a  piece  of  burning  wood  or
charcoal on an iron plate or Tawa.
Cover  it  with  a  glass  jar  or  a
tumbler, or a transparent plastic jar.
Observe  what  happens.  Does
charcoal  stop  burning  after
sometime?  Can  you  think  of  the
reason why it stops burning?

You might have heard that when the
clothes of a person catch fire, the person

is covered with a blanket to extinguish
fire (Fig. 6.3). Can you guess why?

Fig. 6.3 : Blanket wrapped around a person

whose clothes caught fire

Now recall some of your experiences.
Does  a  matchstick  burn  by  itself?

How does it burn?

You must have had an experience of
burning a piece of paper. Does it burn
when a burning matchstick is brought
near it?

Can  you  burn  a  piece  of  wood  by
bringing a lighted matchstick near it?
Why  do  you  have  to  use  paper  or
kerosene oil to start fire in wood or coal?

Have you heard of forest fires?

During  extreme  heat
of  summer,  at  some
places  dry  grasses
catch 
fire.  From
grasses, it spreads to
trees,  and  very  soon
the whole forest is on
fire  (Fig.  6.4).  It  is
very  difficult 
to
control  such  fires.

different  substances  catch  fire  at
different temperatures?

The  lowest  temperature  at  which  a
substance  catches  fire  is  called  its
ignition temperature.

Can you tell now why a matchstick
does not catch fire on its own at room
temperature? Why does the matchstick
start burning on rubbing it on the side
of the matchbox?

The  history  of  the  matchstick  is  very
old.  More  than  five  thousand  years
ago  small  pieces  of  pinewood  dipped
in  sulphur  were  used  as  matches  in
ancient  Egypt.  The  modern  safety
match  was  developed  only  about  two
hundred  years  ago.

A mixture of antimony trisulphide,
potassium  chlorate  and  white
phosphorus  with  some  glue  and
starch  was  applied  on  the  head  of  a
match  made  of  suitable  wood.  When
struck against a rough surface, white
phosphorus got ignited due to the heat
of 
the
combustion  of  the  match.  However,
white  phosphorus  proved  to  be
dangerous  both  for  the  workers
involved  in  the  manufacturing  of
matches  and  for  the  users.

friction.  This  started 

These  days  the  head  of  the  safety
match  contains  only  antimony
trisulphide  and  potassium  chlorate.
The  rubbing  surface  has  powdered
glass  and  a  little  red  phosphorus
(which  is  much  less  dangerous).
When the match is struck against the
rubbing 
red
phosphorus gets converted into white
phosphorus.  This  immediately  reacts
with  potassium  chlorate  in  the
matchstick  head  to  produce  enough
heat  to  ignite  antimony  trisulphide
and  start  the  combustion.

COMBUSTION AND FLAME

We find that a combustible substance
cannot catch fire or burn as long as its
temperature  is  lower  than  its  ignition
temperature.  Have  you  ever  seen
cooking oil catching fire when a frying
pan is kept for long on a burning stove?
Kerosene oil and wood do not catch fire
on their own at room temperature. But,
if kerosene oil is heated a little, it will
catches  fire.  But  if  wood  is  heated  a
little, it would still not catch fire. Does
it  mean  that  ignition  temperature  of
kerosene oil is lower than that of wood?
Does  it  mean  that  we  need  to  take
special care in storing kerosene oil? The
following  activity  shows  that  it  is
essential  for  a  substance  to  reach
ignition temperature to burn.

Activity  6.4

Caution : Be careful while handling
burning candle.
Make two paper cups by folding a
sheet of paper. Pour about 50 mL of
water in one of the cups. Heat both
the  cups  separately  with  a  candle
(Fig. 6.5). What do you observe?

67

© NCERTnot to be republishedIf we continue heating
the cup, we can even boil
water in the paper cup.
Can  you  think  of  an
explanation  for  this
phenomenon?

The heat supplied to
is
the  paper  cup 
transferred  to  water  by
conduction.  So,  in  the
presence  of  water,  the
ignition  temperature  of
paper  is  not  reached.
Hence, it does not burn.
The substances which
have  very  low  ignition
temperature  and  can
easily  catch  fire  with  a
flame 
called
inflammable substances. Examples of
inflammable  substances  are  petrol,
alcohol, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG),
etc. Can you list some more inflammable
substances?

are 

Fig. 6.6: Firemen extinguish the fire by throwing water under pressure

Does  your  city/town  have  a  fire

brigade station?

When  a  fire  brigade  arrives,  what
does  it  do?  It  pours  water  on  the  fire
(Fig. 6.6). Water cools the combustible
material  so  that  its  temperature  is
brought below its ignition temperature.
This  prevents  the  fire  from  spreading.
Water  vapours  also  surround  the
combustible material, helping in cutting
off  the  supply  of  air.  So,  the  fire  is
extinguished.

You have learnt that there are three
essential  requirements  for  producing
fire. Can you list these requirements?

These are: fuel, air (to supply oxygen)
and heat (to raise the temperature of the
fuel  beyond  the  ignition  temperature).
Fire can be controlled by removing one
or more of these requirements. The job
of  a  fire  extinguisher  is  to  cut  off  the
supply  of  air,  or  to  bring  down  the
temperature of the fuel, or both. Notice
that  the  fuel  in  most  cases  cannot  be
SCIENCE

6.2 How do We Control Fire?
You  must  have  seen  or  heard  of  fire
breaking  out  in  homes,  shops  and
factories.  If  you  have  seen  such  an
accident,  write  a  short  description  in
your  note  book.  Also,  share  the
experience with your classmates.

Find out the telephone number of the
fire  service  in  your  area.  If  a  fire
breaks  out  in  your  house  or  in  your
neighbourhood,  the  first  thing  to  do
is  to  call  the  fire  service.

It  is  important  that  all  of  us
know  the  telephone  numbers

of  the  fire  service.

extinguisher  is  water.  But
water  works  only  when
things like wood and paper
are  on  fire.  If  electrical
equipment is on fire, water
may  conduct  electricity
and  harm  those  trying  to
douse  the  fire.  Water  is
also  not  suitable  for  fires
involving oil and petrol. Do
you  recall  that  water  is
heavier  than  oil?  So,  it
sinks below the oil, and oil
keeps  burning  on  top.

Fig. 6.7 : Fire extinguisher

For  fires  involving  electrical  equipment  and  inflammable  materials  like
petrol,  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  is  the  best  extinguisher.  CO2,  being  heavier  than
oxygen,  covers  the  fire  like  a  blanket.  Since  the  contact  between  the  fuel  and
oxygen  is  cut  off,  the  fire  is  controlled.  The  added  advantage  of  CO2  is  that  in
most  cases  it  does  not  harm  the  electrical  equipment.

How do we get the supply of carbon dioxide? It can be stored at high pressure
as  a  liquid  in  cylinders.  In  what  form  is  the  LPG  stored  in  cylinders?  When
released from the cylinder, CO2 expands enormously in volume and cools down.
So,  it  not  only  forms  a  blanket  around  the  fire,  it  also  brings  down  the
temperature of the fuel. That is why it is an excellent fire extinguisher. Another
way  to  get  CO2  is  to  release  a  lot  of  dry  powder  of  chemicals  like  sodium
bicarbonate  (baking  soda)  or  potassium  bicarbonate.  Near  the  fire,  these
chemicals  give  off  CO2.

eliminated.  If,  for  instance,  a  building
catches  fire,  the  whole  building  is  the
fuel.
6.3 Types  of  Combustion
Bring  a  burning  matchstick  or  a  gas
lighter near a gas stove in the kitchen.
Turn on the knob of the gas stove. What
do you observe?

CAUTION : Do not handle the gas
stove yourself. Ask your parents
to help.

We  find  that  the  gas  burns  rapidly
and  produces  heat  and  light.  Such

However,  most  forest  fires  are  due  to
the  carelessness  of  human  beings.  It
is  important  to  remember  that  the
campfires  must  be  completely
extinguished  before  leaving  a  forest
after  a  picnic,  or  a  visit.

We  generally  have  fireworks  on
festival days. When a cracker is ignited,
a sudden reaction takes place with the
evolution  of  heat,  light  and  sound.  A
large  amount  of  gas  formed  in  the
reaction is liberated. Such a reaction is
called explosion. Explosion can also take
place  if  pressure  is  applied  on  the
cracker.

6.4 Flame
Observe an LPG flame. Can you tell the
colour of the flame. What is the colour
of a candle flame?

Recall your experience of burning a
magnesium ribbon in Class VII. If you
do not have experience of burning the
remaining  items  in  Table  6.2  you  can
do that now.

  Record  your  observations  and
mention  whether  on  burning  the
material forms a flame or not.

Charcoal,  on  the  other  hand,  does  not
vapourise  and  so  does  not  produce  a
flame. In Activity 6.6, could the vapours
of wax coming out of the glass tube be
the cause of the flame produced?

6.6 What is a Fuel?
Recall that the sources of heat energy
for domestic and industrial purposes

are  mainly  wood,  charcoal,  petrol,
kerosene,  etc.  These  substances  are
called fuels. A good fuel is one which is
readily  available.  It  is  cheap.  It  burns
easily  in  air  at  a  moderate  rate.  It
produces a large amount of heat. It does
not  leave  behind  any  undersirable
substances.

There is probably no fuel that could
be  considered  as  an  ideal  fuel.  We
should look for a fuel which fulfils most
of the requirements for a particular use.
Fuels differ in their cost. Some fuels

are cheaper than others.

Make a list of fuels familiar to you.
Group them as solid, liquid and gaseous
fuels as in Table 6.3.

6.7 Fuel  Efficiency
Suppose you were asked to boil a given
quantity of water using cow dung, coal
and LPG as fuel. Which fuel would you
prefer? Give your reason. You may take
the help of your parents. Do these three
fuels produce the same amount of heat?
The amount of heat energy produced on
complete combustion of 1 kg of a fuel is
called its calorific value. The calorific
value  of  a  fuel  is  expressed  in  a  unit
called    kilojoule  per  kg  (kJ/kg).
Calorific values of some fuels are given
in Table 6.4.

Burning of Fuels Leads to Harmful
Products
The  increasing  fuel  consumption  has
harmful effects on the environment.
1. Carbon  fuels  like  wood,  coal,
petroleum  release  unburnt  carbon
particles.  These  fine  particles  are
dangerous  pollutants  causing
respiratory diseases, such as asthma.

For  centuries,  wood  was  used  as
domestic and industrial fuel. But now
it has been replaced by coal and other
fuels like LPG. In many rural parts of
our country, people still use wood as
a  fuel  because  of  its  easy  availability
and  low  cost.  However,  burning  of
wood  gives  a  lot  of  smoke  which  is
very  harmful  for  human  beings.  It
causes  respiratory  problem.  Also,
trees  provide  us  with  useful
substances which are lost when wood
is  used  as  fuel.  Moreover  cutting  of
trees  leads  to  deforestation  which
is  quite  harmful  to  the  environment,
as  you  learnt  in  Class  VII.

2. Incomplete combustion of these fuels
gives  carbon  monoxide  gas.  It  is  a
very poisonous gas. It is dangerous
to  burn coal in a closed room. The
carbon monoxide gas produced can
kill persons sleeping in that room.

Oh! So, that is why we are
advised  never  to  sleep  in  a

room  with  burning  or

smouldering  coal  fire  in  it.

3. Combustion  of  most  fuels  releases
carbon dioxide in the environment.
Increased  concentration  of  carbon
dioxide in the air is believed to cause
global warming.

Global  warming  is  the  rise  in
temperature  of  the  atmosphere  of  the
earth.  This  results,  among  other
things, in the melting of polar glaciers,
which  leads  to  a  rise  in  the  sea  level,
causing  floods  in  the  coastal  areas.
Low  lying  coastal  areas  may  even  be
permanently submerged under water.

4. Burning of coal and diesel releases
sulphur  dioxide  gas.  It  is  an
extremely suffocating and corrosive
gas. Moreover, petrol engines give off
gaseous  oxides  of  nitrogen.  Oxides
of sulphur and nitrogen dissolve in
rain water and form acids. Such rain
is called acid rain. It is very harmful
for crops, buildings and soil. You have
already learnt about it in Class VII.
The use of diesel and petrol as fuels
in  automobiles  is  being  replaced  by
CNG (Compressed Natural Gas), because
CNG produces the harmful  products in
very small amounts. CNG is a cleaner fuel.
