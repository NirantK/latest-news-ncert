3 Fibre to Fabric
Paheli and Boojho won the first
prize 
in 
a 
Science Quiz
competition held at their school.
They were very excited and decided to
use the prize money to buy clothes for
their parents. When they saw a large
variety of cloth material, they got
confused (Fig. 3.1). The shopkeeper
explained that some clothes or fabrics
were cotton and some were synthetic.
He also had woollen mufflers and
shawls. There were many silk sarees as
well. Paheli and Boojho felt very excited.
They touched and felt these different
fabrics. Finally, they bought a woollen
muffler and a cotton saree.
After their visit to the cloth shop,
Paheli and Boojho began to notice
various fabrics in their surroundings.
They found that bed sheets, blankets,
curtains, tablecloths, towels and
dusters were made from different kinds
of fabrics. Even their school bags and
the gunny bags were made from
some kind of fabric. They tried to
identify these fabrics as cotton, wool,
silk or synthetic. Can you also identify
some fabrics?

Do you wonder what these different
fabrics are made of? When you look at
any fabric, it seems a continuous piece.
Now, look at it closely. What do you
notice (Fig. 3.2)?

We find that a fabric is made up of
yarns arranged together. What are these
yarns made of?

Activity 3
Take out a yarn from a piece of cotton
fabric. Place this piece of yarn on the
table. Now, press one end of the yarn
with your thumb. Scratch the other end
of the yarn along its length with your
nail as shown in Fig. 3.4.   Do you find
that at this end, the yarn splits up into
thin strands (Fig. 3.5)?
Fig.3.4 Splitting the yarn into thin strands
You might have observed something
similar when you try to thread a
needle. Many a time, the end of the
thread is separated into a few thin
strands. This makes it difficult to pass
the thread through the eye of the
needle. The thin strands of thread that
we see, are made up of still thinner
strands called fibres.
Fabrics are made up of yarns and
yarns are further made up of fibres.
Where do these fibres come from?
The fibres of some fabrics such as
cotton, jute, silk and wool are obtained
from plants and animals. These are
called natural fibres. Cotton and jute
are examples of fibres obtained from
plants. Wool and silk fibres are obtained
from animals. Wool is obtained from the
fleece of sheep or goat. It is also obtained
from the hair of rabbits, yak and
camels. Silk fibre is drawn from the
cocoon of silkworm.
For thousands of years natural fibres
were the only ones available for making
fabrics. In the last hundred years or so,
fibres are also made from chemical

museums, items like the
one shown here. These
were worn by warriors. He
wants to know if these
are made of some
kinds of fibre.

substances, which are not obtained
from plant or animal sources. These are
called synthetic fibres. Some examples
of synthetic fibres are polyester, nylon
and acrylic.
3.3 SOME PLANT FIBRES
Cotton
Have you ever made wicks for oil lamps?
What do you use for making these
wicks? This cotton wool is also used for
filling mattresses, quilts or pillows.
Take some cotton wool, pull it apart
and look at its edges. What do you
observe? The small, thin strands that
you see are made up of cotton fibres.
Where does this cotton wool come
from? It is grown in the fields. Cotton
plants are usually grown at places
having black soil and warm climate. Can
you name some states of our country
where cotton is grown? The fruits of the
cotton plant (cotton bolls) are about the
size of a lemon. After maturing, the bolls
burst open and the seeds covered with
cotton fibres can be seen. Have you ever
Fig.3.6 Field of cotton plants
seen a cotton field that is ready for
picking?  It looks like a field covered with
snow (Fig.3.6).
From these bolls, cotton is usually
picked by hand. Fibres are then
separated from the seeds by combing.
This process is called ginning of cotton.
Ginning was traditionally done by hand
(Fig.3.7). These days, machines are also
used for ginning.
Fig. 3.7 Ginning of cotton
Jute
Jute fibre is obtained from the stem of
the jute plant (Fig 3.8). It is cultivated
during the rainy season. In India, jute is
mainly grown in
West Bengal, Bihar
and Assam. The
jute 
plant 
is
normally harvested
when 
it 
is 
at
flowering stage.
The stems of the
harvested plants
are immersed in
water 
for a 
few
days. The stems rot
and 
fibres 
are
separated by hand.

To make fabrics, all these fibres are
first converted into yarns.  How is
it done?
3.4 SPINNING COTTON YARN
You can try making cotton yarn yourself.
Activity 4
Hold some cotton wool in one hand.
Pinch some cotton between 
the
thumb and forefinger of the
other hand. Now, gently start
pulling out the cotton, while
continuously twisting the
fibres (Fig. 3.9). Are you able
to make a yarn?
The process of making yarn
from fibres is called spinning.
In this process, fibres from a
mass of cotton wool are drawn
out and twisted. This brings
the fibres together to form
a yarn.
A 
simple device used
for 
spinning 
is 
a hand
spindle, also called 
takli
(Fig. 3.10). Another hand
operated device used 
for
spinning 
is 
charkha
(Fig. 3.11). Use of charkha was

popularised by Mahatma Gandhi as part
of the Independence movement. He
encouraged people to wear clothes made
of homespun yarn and shun imported
cloth made in the mills of Britain.
Spinning of yarn on a large scale is
done with 
the help of spinning
machines. After spinning, yarns are
used for making fabrics.
3.5 YARN TO FABRIC
There are many ways by which fabrics
are made from yarns. The two main
processes are weaving and knitting.
Weaving
In Activity 2, you might have noticed
that a fabric is made up of two sets of
yarns arranged together. The process of
arranging two sets of yarns together to
make a fabric is called weaving. Let us
try to weave some paper strips.
Activity 5
Take two sheets of paper of different
colours. Cut square pieces of length and
width equal to 30 cm from each sheet.
Now, fold both the sheets into half. On
one sheet draw lines as shown in the

cuts in the sheet of paper as shown in
Fig.3.12 (c). Fig. 3.12 (d) shows the
pattern after weaving all the strips.

used to make a piece of fabric (Fig. 3.14).
Have you ever pulled the yarn from a
torn pair of socks? What happens? A
single yarn gets pulled out continuously
as the fabric gets unravelled. Socks and
many other clothing items are made of
knitted fabrics. Knitting is done by
hand and also on machines.
Paheli wants to know if you have
seen any fabrics that are made
of the fibres on the outer covering
of coconut. What are these
fibres normally used for?
Fig. 3.13 Handloom
In a similar manner, two sets of yarn
are woven to make a fabric. The yarns
are much thinner than our paper strips,
of course! Weaving of fabric is done on
looms (Fig. 3.13). The looms are either
hand operated or power operated.
Knitting
Have you noticed how sweaters are
knitted? In knitting, a single yarn is

SCIENCE
Weaving and knitting are used for
making different kinds of fabric.
These fabrics are used for a variety of
clothing items.
3.6 HISTORY OF CLOTHING MATERIAL
Have you ever wondered what materials
people used in ancient times for clothes?
It appears that in those times people
used the bark and big leaves of trees or
animal skins and 
furs 
to cover
themselves.
After people began to settle in
agricultural communities, they learnt to
weave twigs and grass into mats and
baskets. Vines, animal fleece or hair were
twisted together into long strands. These
were woven into fabrics. The early Indians
wore fabrics made out of cotton that grew
in the regions near the river Ganga. Flax
is also a plant that gives natural fibres.
In ancient Egypt, cotton as well as flax
were cultivated near the river Nile and
were used for making fabrics.
In those days, stitching was not
known. People simply draped the fabrics
around different parts of their body.
Many different ways of draping fabrics
were used. With the invention of the
sewing needle, people started stitching
fabrics to make clothes. Stitched clothes
have gone through many variations
since this invention. But, is it not
amazing that even today saree, dhoti,
lungi or turban is used as an un-stitched
piece of fabric?
Just as there is a large variety in the
food eaten all over our country, a large
variety exists also in fabrics and
clothing items.

Fabrics are made from yarns, which in turn are made from fibres.
Fibres are either natural or synthetic. Cotton, wool, silk and jute are
some natural fibres, while nylon and polyester are some examples of
synthetic fibres.
Fibres like cotton and jute are obtained from plants.
The process of making yarn from fibres is called spinning.
Fabric from yarns is made by weaving and knitting.

Do you know that famous Sufi Saint and poet Kabir, was a weaver? Find out
about his life and teachings.
You can do an activity to identify the yarns of a fabric under the supervision
of your teacher or parents. Pull out six to eight yarns from the fabric. Hold one
end of the yarn with a tong and bring the other end over the flame of a candle.
Observe carefully. Do the yarns shrink away from the flame? Do the yarns
melt or burn? What type of odour is given off? Note down your observations.
If these are cotton yarns, they burn but do not shrink or melt. The burning
yarn gives an odour similar to burning paper. The silk yarn shrinks away
from the flame and burns but does not melt. It has the odour of charred meat.
The wool yarn also shrinks and burns but does not melt. It has a strong odour
of burning hair. The synthetic yarns shrink and burn. They also melt and
give out an odour similar to burning plastics.
Boojho knows that burning of
cotton yarn gives an odour similar
to burning paper. He is wondering
if he can assume that paper is also
made from plants.
