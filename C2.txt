Components of Food
2
In Chapter 1, we made lists of the
food items that we eat. We also
identified food items eaten in
different parts of India and marked
these on its map.
A meal could consist of chapati, dal
and brinjal curry. Another may be rice,
sambar and a vegetable preparation of
lady’s finger (bhindi). Yet another meal
could be appam, 
fish curry and
vegetables.
curd, butter milk and pickles. Some
examples of meals from different regions
are given in Table 2.1. Select food items
you depicted on the map in Chapter 1.
Add some more meals to this list and
enter these in Table 2.1.
Sometimes, we may not really have
all this variety in our meals. If we are
travelling, we may eat whatever is
available on the way. It may not be
possible for some of us, to eat such a
variety of items, most of the time.
There must be some reason though,
why meals usually consist of such a
distribution. Do you think that our body
needs different kinds of food for some
special purpose?
2.1WHAT DO DIFFERENT FOOD
ITEMS CONTAIN?
Activity 1
Our meals usually have at least one item
made of some kind of grain. Other items
We know that each dish is usually made
could be a dal or a dish of meat and
up of one or more ingredients, which
vegetables. It may also include items like
we get from plants or animals. These

ingredients contain some components
that are needed by our body. These
components are called nutrients. The
major nutrients in our food are named
carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins
and minerals. In addition, food contains
dietary fibres and water which are also
needed by our body.
Do all foods contain all these
nutrients? With some simple methods
we can test whether cooked food or a
raw ingredient contains one or more of
these nutrients. The tests for presence
of carbohydrates, proteins and fats
are simpler to do as compared to the
tests for other nutrients. Let us do these
tests and record all our observations
in Table 2.2.
For carrying out these tests, you will
need solutions of 
iodine, copper
sulphate and caustic soda. You will also
need a few test tubes and a dropper.
Try these tests on cooked food items
as well as raw materials. Table 2.2 shows
you a way to record the observations
from these tests. Some food items are
given in this table. You can conduct the
tests either with these or any other
available food items. Do these tests
carefully and do not try to eat or taste
any chemicals.
If the required solutions are not
available in readymade form, your
teacher can prepare them as follows.
Let us begin by testing different
food items to see if they contain
carbohydrates. There are many
types of carbohydrates. The main
carbohydrates found in our food are in

the form of starch and sugars. We can
easily test if a food item contains starch.
Activity 2
Test for Starch
Take a small quantity of a food item or
a raw ingredient. Put 2-3 drops of dilute
iodine solution on it (Fig. 2.1). Observe
if there is any change in the colour of
the food item. Did it turn blue-black?
Fig. 2.1  Testing for starch
COMPONENTS OF FOOD

A blue-black colour indicates that it
contains starch.
Repeat this test with other food items
to find out which of these contain starch.
Enter all your observations in Table 2.2.
Test for Protein
Take a small quantity of a food item for
testing. If the food you want to
test is a solid, you first need to
make a paste of it or powder it.
Grind or mash a small quantity
of the food item. Put some of this
in a clean test tube, add 10 drops
of water to it and shake the
test tube.
Now, using a dropper, add
two drops of solution of copper
sulphate and ten drops of
solution of caustic soda to the

test tube (Fig. 2.2). Shake well and let
the test tube stand for a few minutes.
What do you see? Did the contents of
the test tube turn violet? A violet colour
indicates presence of proteins in the
food item.
Now, you can repeat this test on other
food items.

SCIENCE
Test for Fats
Take a small quantity of a food item.
Wrap it in a piece of paper and crush it.
Take care that the paper does not tear.
Now, straighten the paper and observe
it carefully. Does it have an oily patch?
Hold the paper against light. Are you
able to see the light faintly, through
this patch?
An oily patch on paper shows that
the food item contains fat. The food
items may sometimes contain a little
water. Therefore, after you have rubbed
an item on paper, let the paper dry for a
while. If there were any water that may
have come from food, it would dry up
after some time. If no oily patch shows
up after this, the food item does not
contain any fat.
What do these tests show? Are fats,
proteins and starch present in all the
food items that you tested? Does a food
item contain more than one nutrient?
Do you find any food item that does not
contain any of these nutrients?
We tested food items for three
nutrients — carbohydrates, proteins
and fats. There are also other nutrients
like vitamins and minerals that are
present in different food items. Why do
we need all these nutrients?
2.2WHAT DO VARIOUS NUTRIENTS DO
FOR OUR BODY?
Carbohydrates mainly provide energy
to our body. Fats also give us energy.
In fact, fats give much more energy
as compared to the same amount of
carbohydrates. Foods containing
fats and carbohydrates are also
called ‘energy giving foods’ (Fig. 2.3
and Fig. 2.4).
Proteins are needed for the growth
and 
repair of our body. Foods

small quantities. Vitamin A keeps our
skin and eyes healthy. Vitamin C helps
body to fight against many diseases.
Vitamin D helps our body to use
calcium for bones and teeth. Foods that
are rich in different vitamins are shown
in Fig. 2.6 to Fig. 2.9.
Minerals are needed by our body in
small amounts. Each one is essential

containing proteins are often called
‘body building foods’ (Fig 2.5).
Vitamins help in protecting our body
against diseases. Vitamins also help in
keeping our eyes, bones, teeth and gums
healthy.
Vitamins are of different kinds
known by different names. Some of these
are Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin D,
Vitamin E and K. There is also a group
of vitamins called Vitamin B-complex.
Our body needs all types of vitamins in

for proper growth of body and to
maintain good health. Some sources of
different minerals are shown in Fig. 2.10.
Most food items, usually, have more
than one nutrient. You may have noticed
this, while recording your observations
in Table 2.2. However, in a given raw
material, one particular nutrient may
be present in much larger quantity than
in others. For example, rice has more
carbohydrates than other nutrients.
Thus, we say that rice is a “carbohydrate
rich” source of food.
Besides these nutrients, our body
needs dietary fibres and water. Dietary
fibres are also known as roughage.
Roughage is mainly provided by plant
products in our foods. Whole grains and
pulses, potatoes, fresh fruits and
vegetables are main sources of roughage.
Roughage does not provide any nutrient
to our body, but is an essential
component of our food and adds to its
bulk. This helps our body get rid of
undigested food.

Water helps our body to absorb
nutrients from food. It also helps in
throwing out some wastes from body as
urine and sweat. Normally, we get most
of the water that our body needs from
the liquids we drink — such as water,
milk and tea. In addition, we add water
to most cooked foods. Let’s see if there
is any other source which provides water
to our body.
Activity 3
Take a tomato or a fruit like lemon. Cut
it into small pieces. Do your hands get
wet while doing so?
Carefully 
observe 
whenever
vegetables and fruits are being cut,
peeled, grated or mashed at your
home. Do you find any fresh vegetables
or fruits that do not contain some
amount of water?
We see that many food materials
themselves contain water. To some
extent, our body needs are met by this
water. Apart from this, we also add water
while cooking many food items.
2.3 BALANCED DIET
The food we normally eat in a day is our
diet. For growth and maintenance of
good health, our diet should have all
the nutrients that our body needs, in
right quantities. Not too much of one
and not too little of the other.  The diet
should also contain a good amount of
roughage and water. Such a diet is called
a balanced diet.
Do you think that people of all ages
need the same type of diet? Do you also
think that, what we need for a balanced
diet would depend on the amount of
physical work that we do?
Prepare a chart of whatever you eat
over a period of a week. Check whether
all the nutrients mentioned are present
in one or the other food items being
eaten within a day or so.
Pulses, 
groundnut, 
soybean,
sprouted seeds (moong and Bengal
gram), fermented foods (South Indian
foods such as idlis), a combination of
flours (missi roti, thepla made from
cereals and pulses), banana, spinach,
sattu, jaggery, available vegetables and
other such 
foods provide many
nutrients. Therefore, one can eat a
balanced diet without expensive food
materials.
Eating the right kind of food is not
enough. It should also be cooked

food also consists of these

properly so that its nutrients are not
lost. Are you aware that some nutrients
get lost in the process of cooking and
preparations?
If the vegetables and fruits are
washed after cutting or peeling them, it
14
SCIENCE
may result in the loss of some vitamins.
The skins of many vegetables and fruits
contain 
vitamins and minerals.
Similarly, repeated washing of rice and
pulses may remove some vitamins and
minerals present in them.
We all know that cooking improves
the taste of food and makes it easier to
digest. At the same time, cooking also
results in the loss of certain nutrients.
Many useful proteins and considerable
amounts of minerals are lost if excess
water is used during cooking and is
then thrown away.
Vitamin C gets easily destroyed by
heat during cooking. Would it not be
sensible to include some fruits and raw
vegetables in our diet?
Boojho thought that fats would be
the best foods to eat, all the time. A katori
of fat will give much more energy than
a katori of carbohydrate rich food, isn’t
it? So, he ate nothing but food rich in
fats — fried food like samosa and poori,
malai, rabdi and peda.
Do you think he was right? No, of
course not! It can be very harmful for
us to eat too much of fat rich foods and
we may end up suffering from a
condition called obesity.
2.4 DEFICIENCY DISEASES
A person may be getting enough food to
eat, but sometimes the food may not
contain a particular nutrient. If this
continues over a long period of time, the
person may suffer from its deficiency.
Deficiency of one or more nutrients can
cause diseases or disorders in our body.
Diseases that occur due to lack of
nutrients over a long period are called
deficiency diseases.
If a person does not get enough
proteins in his/her food for  a long time,
he/she is likely to have stunted growth,
swelling of face, discolouration of hair,
skin diseases and diarrhoea.
If the diet is deficient in both
carbohydrates and proteins for a long
period of time, the growth may stop
completely. Such a person becomes very
lean and thin and so weak that he/she
may not even be able to move.
Deficiency of different vitamins and
minerals may also result in certain
diseases or disorders. Some of these are
mentioned in Table 2.3.
All deficiency diseases can be
prevented by taking a balanced diet.
In this chapter, we asked ourselves
the reason why widely varying food from
different regions had a common
