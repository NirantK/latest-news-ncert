Food:
Where Does It Come From?
What did you eat at home
today? Find out what your
friend ate today. Did you eat
the same kind of food yesterday and
today? We all eat different kinds of food
at different times, isn’t it?
1.1 FOOD VARIETY
Activity 1
Ask your friends in the school about the
items they would be eating during a day.
See if you can also get this information
from friends staying in different states
of India. List all the items in your
notebook as given in Table 1.1, for as
many friends as possible.

There seems to be so much variety
in the food that we eat. What are these
food items made of?
Think about 
rice
cooked at home. We take
raw rice and boil it in
water. Just two materials
or ingredients are needed to prepare a
dish of boiled rice.
On the other hand, some food items
are made with many ingredients. To
prepare vegetable curry, we need
different kinds of vegetables, salt, spices,
oil and so on.
Activity 2
Choose some of the items you listed in
Table 1.1 and try to find out what
ingredients are used to prepare these,
by discussing with your friends and
elders at home. List them in Table 1.2.
Some examples are given here. Add
some more items to this list.

What do we find? Do we find some ingredients common
for different food items? Discuss in class.
So, where do these ingredients come from?
1.2FOOD MATERIALS AND SOURCES
It may be easy for us to guess the sources of some of the
ingredients that we listed in Table 1.2. Fruits and
vegetables, for instance. Where do they come from? Plants,
of course! What are the sources of rice or wheat? You may
have seen paddy or wheat fields with rows and rows of
plants, which give us these grains.
And then, there are food items like milk, eggs, meat,
chicken, fish, prawns, beef, pork and such others, which
come from animals.
Activity 3
Let us take the food items listed earlier
and try to find out where they come from
— the ingredients and their sources.
Some examples are shown in Table 1.3.
Fill in the blanks in Table 1.3 and add
more examples to this list.

SCIENCE
What do we conclude from Activity
3? Plants are the sources of food
ingredients 
like grains, cereals,
vegetables and fruits. Animals provide
us with milk, meat products and eggs.
Cows, goats and buffaloes are some
common animals which give us milk.
Milk and milk products like butter,
cream, cheese and curd are used all over
the world. Can you name some other
animals which give us milk?
1.3PLANT PARTS AND ANIMAL
PRODUCTS AS FOOD
Plants are one source of our food. Which
parts of a plant are these?
We eat many leafy vegetables. We eat
fruits of some plants. Sometimes roots,
sometimes stems and even flowers. Have
Paheli wants to know if any of our
food comes from sources other
than plants and animals.

Some plants
have two  or more
edible (eatable)
parts. Seeds of
mustard plants
give us oil and
the 
leaves are
used 
as 
a
vegetable. Can
you think of the
different parts of a banana plant that
are used as food?  Think of more
examples where many parts of a single
plant are used as food.

Roots
Activity 4
From all the food items you have listed
in Table 1.3, choose those items whose
ingredients are obtained from plants.
Which part of a plant? Identify these
and list the food items and plant parts
as shown in Table 1.4.

FOOD: WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?

Do not try to test unknown plants
around you to see if they are edible!
Some plants could be poisonous.
Activity  5
Take some dry seeds of moong or chana.
Put a small quantity of seeds in a
container filled with water and leave this
aside for a day. Next day, drain the water
completely and leave the seeds in the
vessel. Wrap them with a piece of wet
cloth and set aside. The following day,
do you observe any changes in the seed?
A small white structure may have grown
out of the seeds. If so, the seeds have
sprouted. If not, wash the seeds in water,
drain the water and leave them aside
for another day, covered with a wet cloth.
The next day, see if the seeds have
sprouted.
After washing these sprouted seeds,
you can eat them. They can also be
boiled. Add some spices and  get a tasty
snack to eat.
Do you know where honey comes
from, or how it is produced? Have you
seen a beehive where so many bees keep
buzzing 
about?
Bees collect nectar
(sweet juices)  from
flowers, convert it
into honey and
store 
it 
in their
hive. Flowers and
their nectar may be
available only for a
part of the year. So,
bees 
store 
this
nectar for their use
all 
through 
the
year. When we find
such a beehive, we collect the food stored
by the bees as honey.
1.5 WHAT DO ANIMALS EAT?
Do you have cattle or a pet that you
take care of? A dog, cat, buffalo or a
goat? You will then surely be aware of
the food, the animal eats. What about
other animals? Have you ever observed
what a squirrel, pigeon, lizard or a small
insect may be eating as their food?
Activity 6
Several animals are listed in Table 1.5.
For some of them, the type of food they

plant products in Group 1. These are
called herbivores. There are some
animals which eat other animals.
Place these in Group 2. These animals
are called carnivores. Do you find
some animals which eat both plants
and animals? Place them in Group 3.
These are called omnivores. Prepare
a table as in Table 1.6 and enter
these separately in the three columns,
as shown.

Paheli wants to know where you
would place human beings,
while filling Table 1.6.
We know that there are many
amongst us, who do not get sufficient
food. We need to find ways by which
more food can be grown in the country.
That will not be enough; we will need to
find ways to ensure that this food is
made easily available to each and every
one of us.

the table.

Have a look again at Table 1.5 and group
the animals entered here as follows.

There is a lot of variation in the food eaten in different regions of India.
The main sources of our food are plants and animals.
Animals which eat only plants are called herbivores.
Animals which eat only animals are called carnivores.
Animals which eat both plants as well as other animals are called
omnivores.
Do you find that all living beings need the same kind of food?
Name five plants and their parts that we eat.

You must have seen a garden lizard around your home. Next time when-
ever you see it, observe carefully and find out what it takes for food. Is the
food different from that of a house lizard?
Make a list (with pictures, when possible) of food items generally taken by
people of different regions of India. Place these on a large outline map of
India to display in your classroom.
Find out the names of plants that grow in water and which are eaten
as food.
In Chapter 10, you will find out ways of measuring length of curved lines.
In your mathematics classes you will learn to prepare bar graphs. After
you learn these, try the following interesting project. Prepare some sprouts
of moong as discussed in the chapter. Wash them in water everyday and
drain all the water. Let them grow for a week until the whole of the seeds
grow into young plants. Measure the lengths of the sprouts everyday using
a string. Take care that they do not break. Prepare a bar graph of the
number of sprouts having lengths in different ranges.
